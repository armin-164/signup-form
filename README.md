# signup-form
This is the sign-up form project from The Odin Project.

In this project, I will create a sign up form using the 
knowledge that I have gained in the Intermediate HTML and CSS
Course that TOP provides.

Note that I built this project on a Chromebook, and because 
I haven't been introduced to responsive design, it might
look weird on other screens besides small laptops.
